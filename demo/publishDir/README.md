## netlify-plugin-rss fixture

here is an example of a typical publish folder with top level files we dont want indexed in RSS, and then a `/blog` directory where we do want to generate an RSS feed. Check out [rss.xml](/rss.xml) for the generated feed from running our plugin code. (mocked in [rssfixture.js](../rssfixture.js))
